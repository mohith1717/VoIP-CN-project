# VoIP-CN-project implemented in SEM-4 as a part of mini-project
Steps to implement this :-
  
  (i)Create a virtual environment

  
  (ii)Run the server.py file using command python server.py(make sure to get the correct IP address and paste it in HOST)

  
  (iii)Run the client.py file using command python client.py(same here as well,the IP addresses of server and client should match)

  
  (iv)You can implement this in in multiple systems as well(with mulitple clients)as server recieves the audio and sends it to all clients connected to the respective server



NOTE:-(i)Make sure to use the python-3.12.2 interpreter as there can some issue while using "PyAudio"
      (ii)The client(different_system and on_my_system) is the same(A duplicate).
